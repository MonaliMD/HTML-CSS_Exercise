Reasons why to chose to code the layout in this way.

I chose 'Float Layout' layout type for this exercise because of the browser comparability requirement.
Sometimes modern layout types like 'Flex Box' and 'CSS Grid' do not support for some browsers.
According to the simple UI Design, I think Float Layout type is more suitable for this exercise and moreover I am more comfortable 
with that too :)

I used SASS and compiled into CSS. I checked the supportability  for most browsers like Chrome, Firefox, IE11, Opera and MS Edge but unfortunately I couldn'tt
check test this on Safari as I am using a Windows PC right now.

And for mobile view, I decided to make the search bar appear in the middle of the header section.
Because of the mobile interfaces are having limited space, we have to optimize the screen space available in mobile devices. Content and 
side bar have been set vertically one after another for the mobile view because I thought the high priority should be given to the content rather 
the sidebar.
